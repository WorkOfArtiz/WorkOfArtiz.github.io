                    afterwords as a post-hoc rationalization. Discuss whether this adagium of Parnas applies

        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>There is current trend for people to use the TV and the Web simultaneously using various devices, such as
                phones, laptops and tablets. These âsecond screenâ user experiences have some drawbacks, for example,
                people
                are having to focus on more than one screen at a time, their attention divided between the two. Also the
                ergonomics can be awkward; with laptops balanced on knees, looking down on tablets or smart phones, no
                haptic feedback from touch devices and thumbs typing on tiny keyboards. Moreover, when youâre following
                an
                online conversation about a programme you want to be able to comment quickly, so the act of typing canât
                be
                too difficult or distracting. In addition to making it easier to read and input text, second screens
                have
                several other user experience advantages over a single integrated Web/TV screen. For example, they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Donât take the user away from main viewing experience</li>
                <li>Donât clutter the TV screen with graphics/widgets</li>
                <li>Allow for the potential for personalised interfaces: in most cases, itâs my social network but our
                    TV,
                    so displaying personal social network comments on the TV screen, as well as being a usability
                    nightmare,
                    is also a privacy problem.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recently broadcasters and Internet start-ups have started to design Social TV apps specifically for
                second
                screen and remote controls TV experiences. Several apps and sites (such as Netflix, Hulu, Philo, Miso,
                and
                GetGlue) have repurposed the check-in concept popularised by Foursquare, Facebook and many other social
                media aps and adapted it for TV for a shared television watching experience. Other services are
                concentrating on integration with Twitter and Facebook. However, it is not clear at the moment what
                these
                second screen applications give the user that existing tools (such as using Twitter or Facebook on a
                laptop
                or phone) do not.</p>

            <p>You are a designer team and you have to design an interface and interaction on a touchscreen used as a
                second
                screen before, after or while watching TV (for examples see below). The goal of the second screen is to
                provide a personal space for the TV viewers to interact with the TV while watching, e.g. (1) participate
                in
                online conversations about a TV programme, so that viewers in different places can share and discuss
                their
                thoughts, (2) play along: e.g.Â by real-time voting and predictions (âWhich contestant will win?â),
                answering
                trivia questions etc. (3) navigate to content: e.g.Â browsing through an archive collection and selecting
                a
                programme to watch, perhaps based on social recommendations, (4) access supplementary information about
                a
                programme (synchronised to the broadcast). Additionally, the second screen tablet could be used to also
                control the TV: i.e.Â using the second screen as a remote control to actually change whatâs happening on
                the
                TV screen.</p>

            <p>In order to inspire yourself and gather background information about what features and functionality such
                a
                second screen table should have, you can explore features in existing applications as second screen (see
                examples below).</p>

                <h4>General guidelines for all three assignments (Domain I):</h4>

                <p><strong>Target group:</strong> Choose a target age group of your users, preferably excluding your own
                    age
                    group (i.e.Â 19-25). If you choose for your own age group you have to show explicitly that you didnât
                    use
                    your group or other course groups as test users. Example choices: high school (12-18), elderly
                    (65+).
                </p>

                <p><strong>Users:</strong> Collect input and feedback from at least 4 potential users from your target
                    group. Each team member is responsible for at least 1 user. The more users you address the better.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Tasks:</strong> Select four out of the six tasks below to cover in the assignments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create personalised playlists of programs to watch, to record, etc.</li>
                    <li>Browse, search and navigate to content, e.g.Â browse through a TV program collection and select a
                        programme to watch; consider here browsing through general lists, recommended lists, favourites,
                        overall search, specific searches, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tag, rate, share, recommend (to a friend, or group of friends); consider here sharing on the
                        social
                        web, e.g.Â FB, Google+, Twitter, etc, or also sharing inside your application with friends that
                        are
                        also member of the same app
                    </li>
                    <li>Favourite a TV program or a channel, or a series of programs</li>
                    <li>Post comments in a discussion about a TV program</li>
                    <li>Access supplementary information about a programme prior to and while watching; consider here
                        also
                        supplementary information on the Web, e.g.Â IMDB, Wikipedia, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, include <strong>at least two</strong> other second screen-specific features of your
                    choice.
                    You should derive these tasks from your target users. These features should be innovative, creative
                    and
                    specifically targeting a current gap (related to your user group) or the domain of Second Screens;
                    Support the choice for those two features with literature study and from the user study of your
                    target
                    group, that there is a real need for such features, and that they ultimately will improve the user
                    experience of your users.</p>

                <p>Some issues to explore in your requirements gathering, design and evaluation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Attention/Distraction:</strong> How much can the second screen experience interrupt the
                        process of watching TV? In what circumstances does the second screen start to impair the
                        experience,
                        rather than enhance peopleâs enjoyment of it?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Struggle of cognitive resources:</strong> How do users deal with the competition for
                        attention between the two screens and having to flip between them? Does it depend on their state
                        of
                        mind e.g.Â when they are tired and want to be passively entertained compared to when they are
                        feeling
                        alert and want to actively engage? Does the type of programme matter?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Level of detail of presented information:</strong> How can users avoid such information
                        overload? What sort of filters should be available besides the ability to filter tweets by
                        friends
                        for example?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Synchronisation:</strong> How clear is the relationship between the main (TV) screen
                        content
                        and the second screen content?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Level of control:</strong> How much do users want to be able to customise their âsecond
                        screenâ - e.g.Â set the desired level of interruption and information density, or make
                        adjustments
                        for accessibility requirements such as poor sight or hearing difficulties?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Information overload:</strong> How do you deal with the fact that there are too many
                        programs to choose from? How do you help your users finding easily and quickly what they are
                        searching for without being overwhelmed with options and content?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Context of use:</strong> How do you deal with the fact that people use this app in
                        different
                        context, e.g.Â when they are alone, when they are together with friends, with family, when they
                        are
                        in the train, in the plane, etc.? How does different context influence the usability and the
                        demand
                        for different support features?
                    </li>

            <p>Wearable computers (i.e.Â wearables) are typically developed to support users in physical environment.
                They
                can provide a constant interaction between the computer and user by sensing the environment (i.e.Â user
                context), thus often there is no need to turn the device on or off or to start a particular application.
                They also support multitasking, by allowing you to continue what you were doing while using the device
                (which is seamlessly augmented into the usersâ context). Until recently, most of those devices were
                primarily developed and used either in research settings, or in sci-fi movies (e.g.Â prosthetics as an
                extension of the userâs hands, arms, head or event mind). Their intrusiveness in terms of size, shape
                and
                need for continuous power and connectivity, typically made them unusable in general context. Recently,
                with
                the introduction of Google Glass and Samsung Galaxy Gear, Apple Watch and the whole range of smart
                watches
                available on the market, such devices become more popular in common use. However, with the increase in
                their
                popularity, more and more issues arise in the context of their use. For example, they could:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Distract the user from the current activity</li>
                <li>Obstruct the view of the user</li>
                <li>Be too slow to react to the usersâ request</li>
                <li>Consume too much power - exhausting batteries fast</li>
                <li>Be too big and too small at the same time</li>
                <li>Be of a security risk</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recently different companies started developing mainstream wearables, e.g.Â activity trackers wristbands
                Fibit, Nike+ Fuelband and Jawbone UP. Smartwatches, extending the interaction with smart phones seem to
                get
                more and more popular, e.g.Â Samsun Gear, Moto 360, Apple Watch, and many more still in design stages.
                However, it is not clear what the best mode of interaction is with such devices, and how to measure
                usability.</p>

            <p>You are a designer team and you have to design an interface and interaction on a Smart Watch (connected
                to a
                smart phone) to manipulate audio and music related apps. The goal of this device is to provide an easy
                access to your music and other audio apps, e.g. (1) navigate to audio content: e.g.Â browsing through a
                music
                and podcasts collection and selecting an item to play across different music consuming apps, (2) to
                change
                songs, (3) adjust volume, (4) favourite or share a song or add it to a playlist, (5) access
                supplementary
                information about a song or podcast, such as lyrics, album, etc., (6) buy songs, (7) link to their
                YouTube
                videos, (8) see their popularity on Twitter, etc.</p>

            <p>In order to inspire yourself and gather background information about what features and functionality such
                a
                Smartwatch wearable touch screen, you can explore features in existing Smart Phones and various audio

                        - e.g.Â set the desired level of interruption and information density, or make adjustments for
                        accessibility requirements such as poor sight or hearing difficulties?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Information overload:</strong> How do you deal with the fact that there are too many
                        songs
                        to choose from? How do you help your users finding easily and quickly what they are searching
                        for
                        without being overwhelmed with options and content?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Context of use:</strong> How do you deal with the fact that people use this app in
                        different
                        context, e.g.Â when they are on the road in a train, or when they are biking, or when they are at
                        a
                        party, or at home? How does different context influence the usability and the demand for
                        different
                        support features?
                    </li>

                <p>The result of the assignment should be a report covering the first two phases of HCI development:
                    requirements gathering and conceptual design. The report should contain the following
                    elements:</p>

                <p><strong>Domain characterization:</strong></p>

                <p>Textual description of your domain. Here you specify the device/platform and other aspects of the
                    domain.
                    Prepare this by analysing similar systems and related interfaces (use as a basis the links given
                    in the
                    overall assignment information). Present references to sites or systems you found yourself
                    during this
                    domain analysis phase. Indicate, the questions from your interviews or survey with target users
                    have
                    also
                    contributed to the domain description. Expected size: half page (plus the references to material
                    you
                    found,
                    studied and read).</p>

                <p><strong>User characteristics:</strong></p>

                <p>Describe user characteristics using the template of Table 3.2. Indicate which questions in your
                    interviews or
                    surveys have contributed to creating this target user profile. Show the initial user profile and
                    how it
                    changed into the detailed user profile after the interview/survey or focus group with the users.
                    Also
                    include one typical âPersonaâ description that you have envisioned for your users.</p>

                <p><strong>Task characteristics:</strong></p>

                <p>Select two tasks and describe their task characteristics (example: see Table 4.2).</p>

                <p><strong>Task sequences:</strong></p>

                <p>Consider whether the two selected tasks require particular sequences, e.g.Â because one task
                    requires
                    output
                    from another task. Document alternative task sequences with a template such as shown in Table
                    4.3.</p>

                <p><strong>Task analysis:</strong></p>

                <p>For the two selected tasks construct:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a task scenario (example: see Box 4.3)</li>
                    <li>a concrete use case (example: see Fig. 4.3)</li>
                    <li>an essential use case (example: see Fig. 4.4)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Task objects:</strong></p>

                <p>Identify the main task objects in the use cases and specify these objects using a format such as
                    used in
                    Tables 8.1 and 8.2.</p>

                <p><strong>Content diagrams:</strong></p>

                <p>Define one overall content diagram (example: see Fig. 8.19) and one content diagram per use case
                    (examples:
                    see Figs. 8.17 and 8.18).</p>

                <p><strong>Usability metrics:</strong></p>

                <p>Define your specific usability goals using the template provided in Table 6.3. Do not copy the
                    content of
                    the
                    table, but define the goals specific for your application and scenario. Ex. changing channels
                    should
                    happen
                    in .5 sec; changing volume should be with max 1 click, etc.</p>

                <p><strong>Non-functional HCI requirements:</strong></p>

                <p>You can limit the description here to requirements w.r.t accessibility and privacy. This is the
                    initial
                    list
                    of requirements, which will have to be extended/adapted in each follow-up assignment.</p>

                <p>To be able to get the results listed in the previous section, you will have to do data collection
                    from
                    prospective users. You are expected to collect data from at least 4 users (see general
                    information about
                    the
                    assignments). In the report you should document two data collection techniques with all 4 (or
                    more)
                    users:</p>

                <p><strong>Structured interview:</strong></p>

                <p>List the questions to be asked during the interview, including a one line rationale for each
                    question.
                    For
                    background information see Ch. 3.</p>

                <p><strong>Questionnaire:</strong></p>

                <p>Construct a questionnaire with 8-10 questions. Explain briefly the rationale of the question and
                    the
                    format
                    used for recording the answer. For background information see Ch. 3</p>

                <p>Conduct structured interviews with all 4 of your target users. Collect data from an online
                    questionnaire
                    with
                    all 4 users and possibly with a few more volunteers. To have representativeness of the data
                    collection,
                    it
                    would be useful to find additional people in your target group to send the questionnaire to, as
                    4 users
                    is a
                    small number for a questionnaire.</p>

                <p>The data-collection process should be documented in an appendix of the report. This appendix
                    should
                    contain a
                    data-collection diary (activity list) and the information about the setup of the interviews and
                    the
                    questionnaire . In the body of the report include the main conclusions that you were able to
                    draw based
                    on
                    this data collected. In the appendix you can list all the conclusions. Report on things that
                    went wrong,
                    or
                    you could have done better next time.</p>

                <p>Consult the course book for techniques to construct the various results. In particular for the
                    task
                    analysis,
                    the task objects and the content diagrams, first read the relevant chapters (Chs 4. and 8)
                    carefully to

                <p><strong>Use of UML:</strong></p>

                <p>You are free to use UML diagrams as an add-on to, or in place of, techniques described in the
                    book. This
                    holds in particular for representing (1) use cases through UML use-case diagrams, (2) task
                    sequences
                    through
                    UML activity diagrams, and (3) task objects through UML class diagrams.</p>

                <p><strong>Interviews:</strong></p>

                <p>You should use the interviews, amongst other things, to get information on potential additional
                    tasks
                    that
                    you like to define (must be at least two).</p>

                <p>For online surveys you can use tools such as Google Forms or SurveyMonkey, or Facebook or any
                    other tools
                    that you are already familiar with.</p>

    <h2>Assignment 2: HCI Prototyping</h2>

    <div id="purpose-1" class="section level3">
        <h3>Purpose</h3>

        <p>The purpose of this assignment is to get a thorough understanding of the process of as well as techniques
            for
            HCI prototyping, with an emphasis on the early phases of development. The purpose is
            <strong>not</strong> to
            train UI programming.</p>

        <p>In this assignment your team will go through two cycles of development of a mock-up prototype. In each
            cycle
            you will do a basic evaluation through a cognitive walkthrough respectively a heuristic evaluation.</p>

        <h3>Reading material</h3>

        <p>For this assignment we assume you are familiar with Chs. 1-19 and 26 of the course book. This assignment
            focuses in particular on techniques described in Ch. 6 (Sec. 6) and Ch. 26. The techniques you need for
            the
            assignment are covered in detail in the the slides of the lecture on Prototyping; study these slides
            carefully before starting the assignment.</p>

                    <p>The result of the assignment should be an extension of the report produced during Assignment 1,
                        It should
                        contain the following new elements:</p>

                    <p><strong>Paper-based prototype:</strong></p>

                    <p>Construct a low-fidelity prototype of your UI design developed in Assignment 1. The prototype
                        should be
                        paper-based and use sketches and/or storyboards as main technique(s). The techniques you need
                        are
                        discussed
                        in the lecture on prototyping (consult the slides). The results should be a number of photos or
                        scans of
                        the
                        prototype, together with explanation of all the design decisions. You can also use a tool like
                        <a
                                href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> or any of the other tools for low-fidelity
                        prototyping
                        in the Appendix list at the end of this assignment. The content diagrams developed in Assignment
                        1 are
                        the
                        main starting point for the prototype. .</p>

                    <p><strong>Cognitive walkthrough:</strong></p>

                    <p>Perform a cognitive walkthrough of the prototype for each of the tasks you identified. For each
                        task ask
                        one
                        group member should act as evaluator. Ask the evaluator to âthink aloudâ; the other group
                        members should
                        record the remarks made. Analyse the results and summarize the positive and negative feedback
                        you have
                        collected during those sessions. Indicate what changes/updates you need to do as a result of the
                        cognitive
                        walkthrough. Add the data collected (e.g.Â notes made during think-aloud) as an appendix to the
                        report.</p>

                    <p><strong>Software-based mock-up prototype:</strong></p>

                    <p>Construct now a revised version of your mock-up, taking the results of the cognitive walkthrough
                        into
                        account. Use for this mock-up a tool such as Powerpoint, HTML or some other visual editing tool
                        you are
                        familiar with. Check out the list of tools included in the Appendix at the end of this
                        assignment.
                        Include
                        screenshots and URLs in the report. Give explanations of the prototype parts and the design
                        choices/rational
                        you followed in order to make them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Heuristic evaluation:</strong></p>

                    <p>Conduct a heuristic evaluation of the second prototype. Use the Nielsen heuristics of Table 26.1
                        as the
                        baseline for the evaluation (see also the example evaluation in Box 26.1). Ask one person from
                        one of
                        the
                        other teams to act as evaluator/inspector. Include a summary of the results in table-form (see
                        Table
                        26.3)
                        in the report. Discuss implications for the UI design. Include the data collection form (Table
                        26.2) as
                        an
                        appendix to the report.</p>

                    <p><strong>Change history:</strong></p>

                    <p>During prototyping you are likely find out that parts of your requirements description and/or
                        conceptual
                        design were missing/insufficient/wrong. This is not a bug but a feature! Adjust where needed the
                        requirements and design (as documented in Assignment 1) and add a change history to the report.
                        In this
                        change history you keep track of updates in a tabular form: date, person, change made and reason
                        for the
                        change.</p>

                        be extended/adapted in this assignment as well as in assignment 3.</p>

                    <p><strong>Recording data collection:</strong></p>

                    <p>Consider using audio or video recording during the cognitive walkthroughs and/or heuristic
                        evaluation.
                        Donât
                        depend solely on your memory! At the minimum make extensive notes during the data-collection
                        process.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cooperation with other teams:</strong></p>

                    <p>For heuristic evaluation you will need to cooperate with one other team. Make sure you agree
                        early with
                        them
                        how to make this work.</p>

                        realized in the prototypes of Assignment 2).</p>

                    <p>For each task you should define the following:</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>Select summarization techniques of results (e.g.Â mean for time spent, mean for number of
                            steps).
                        </li>
                        <li>Qualitative conclusions are you interested in, e.g. âWe want to see how satisfied the users

                        </li>
                        <li>Quantitative conclusions are you interested in, e.g. âWe will check how much the users
                            deviated from the
                            desired (mean) for number of steps in using our system.â

                        <li>Strategy for confirming/rejecting your hypotheses based on this summarized data, e.g.Â if the
                            users make
                            on the average 2 steps to fulfil the task, than our interface is â¦.â.

                    <p>The final result should be an extension of the report of Assignment 2. If your analysis gives
                        rise to changes

                                concerning multiple
                                hypotheses. For this reason, the overall experimental plan is for all hypotheses. You
                                should
                                indicate which parts of the plan are targeted at which hypothesis, where relevant.

                        result of
                        your assignments. The rooms for the presentations can be found in the schedule (at the time of
                        the
                        last lab
                        session).</p>

                    <p>You are asked to prepare a presentation of max 7 slides, according to the following
                        structure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>title slide: names, group number, selected domain, name of your application</li>
                        <li>user profile (also specific one)</li>
                        <li>requirements &amp; tasks (focus on the 2 selected)</li>
                        <li>UI design (content diagrams, etc.)</li>
                        <li>the prototypes (low &amp; high fidelity)</li>
                        <li>(results of) cognitive walkthrough &amp; heuristic evaluation</li>
                        <li>experimental design under development in Assignment 3</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The presentation slot per group is 10 minutes (7 mins presentation + 3 mins for questions). Make
                        sure
                        you
                        stay strictly within the presentation time. Only the quality of the slides will be graded (but
                        use
                        the
                        presentation itself as a training of your presentation expertise!). You will be stopped exactly
                        after 7 mins
                        of presentation, which might not allow you to present everything, and thus points can be
                        deducted.
                        This
                        grade will form part of the overall grade for Assignment 3. Submit your slides (as PDF) via
